Workforce Optimization Analytics
Problem statement: Customer has random income order flow but fixed number of employees. Presently customer does not have any control over the number of orders received or their complexity. Each order has its own complexity that requires special skill sets from the employees. To meet the demand, presently customer is cross-training their employees randomly. They would like to minimize their training costs and better prepared for the incoming order demands.
Failure to meet deadlines or unable to cope up with incoming orders could happen due to multiple reasons, one of them being in all departments there is a shortage of resources not enough to meet even the lowest order volume. In such case, training will not help at all - as moving people will only increase the speed of that particular dept. while still halting the other parts of the full pipeline. Hence our goal is to first understand the pattern of the incoming orders, their resource demands and gaps and where further optimization can lead to a quicker turnaround and delivery of the orders
Initial Project Goals 
The initial project goals were as follows:
1.	Once an order is approved what is the typical delay for an order to actually start"
2.	Is the delay varying with complexity- didn’t do this
3.	What is the behaviour of this delay - is it varying w.r.to resource availability ?"
4.	At any point of time, how many orders are being processed in parallel
5.	What are the no. of parallel orders being executed 
6.	What is my lowest no. of orders at any given time
7.	What is the highest no. of orders at any given time
8.	What is my lowest no. of parallel orders for dept. X below which the order count never go low, and the highest"
9.	Whether there is any relationship between Production Delay and Production Time
Project Goals Achieved
In addition to all the above goals were able to drill down to the function in each order and answer the queries in much more detail.
1.	We can add additional business insights that we were able to extract here…(can use the shiny app for that)
2.	Production Delay details and to understand the Production Delay pattern
